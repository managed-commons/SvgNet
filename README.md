# SvgNet

A fork of the SvgNet & SvgGdi bridge (http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/svgnet.aspx) to ressurrect it.

__SvgNet is now available as a Nuget:__ [SvgNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SvgNet/).

__Latest version 2.2.2 is .NET Standard 2.0 and 2.1 and also .NET 5.0/6.0 (base and Windows) compatible and works with .NET Core 2.x and 3.x and .NET 5.0/6.0, but now requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher__

To build this version properly you need .NET 6.0.100+ SDK installed
